# ES6-js

## What is ECMAScript?

ECMAScript is the **standard**, Javascript is the **implementation** of that standard.

Basically, Javascript, the programming language follow the standard rules of **ECMAScript**.

We are currently in ECMAScript version 6.

**Note:**

> So, if you are updating to ES6 version, you have to know that most browsers take some time to support the new versions of ECMAScript.

## How do I make sure that my code works in all browsers?

There's something called **BABEL**.

**BABEL** is a tool that transpiles (converts in other words) your ES6 code to the previous version (in this case ES5). That's gonna work and will be safe to run in your browser.
